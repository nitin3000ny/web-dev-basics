<h2>about</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    I am a B.Tech E.C student at Banasthali Vidyapith, passionate about learning new technologies and developing innovative solutions. 

    I am also an active member of several communities and programs that aim to empower and support women and students in technology, such as Google's Women Techmakers, Google Developer Students Club, and GirlScript Summer of Code. Through these platforms, I have gained access to curated resources, events, and opportunities that have helped me grow my Google Cloud skills,network with peers and mentors, and contribute to open source projects. My goal is to continue learning, improving, and sharing my knowledge and experience with others.
